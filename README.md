This is my first application written in React.
I wanted to expand the functionality of this application, which is basic for a beginner, as much as possible in order to work out more non-obvious points in practice.
In addition, since I am currently a ux/ui designer, I drew the design and user path myself. If you are interested in taking a look and/or want to use the design for your practice, you can grab it from [Figma here.](https://www.figma.com/design/sEc0RjQQMu5sK4DkE966Ec/Todo-App?node-id=1-2&t=OlmE4URZ1A1dO0HC-1)

You can view the app [here](https://yrsh-02-n.github.io/react-todo-app/)

The application can:
1. Add and remove tasks
2. Mark tasks as completed
3. Delete all tasks or delete only those tasks that are marked as completed
4. Count the number of completed tasks
5. The application will not allow you to add an empty task

List of used NPM packages:
1. uuid - to generate unique task IDs
2. React Icons - for embedding icons Remix Icons
